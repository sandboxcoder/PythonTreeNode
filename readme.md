This is your basic TreeNode implementation. I enjoy working with TreeNode data structures so figured it would be a good idea to put up a quick example.

Below is the command you should use to execute this program:

```bash
python main.py
```

This script will build a tree and run the typical traversal techniques: inorder, postorder, preorder, & level order.

Look at the following image of the tree we are building:

![alt text](level_order_traversal.png "Tree Node Graph")

The Output from the Program is expected to be the following:

Depth First Traversals:

(a) Inorder (Left, Root, Right) : 4 2 5 1 3

(b) Preorder (Root, Left, Right) : 1 2 4 5 3

(c) Postorder (Left, Right, Root) : 4 5 2 3 1

Breadth First or Level Order Traversal : 1 2 3 4 5
